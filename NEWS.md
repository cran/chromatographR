# chromatographR 0.4.1

* Extended package DESCRIPTION and added citations to relevant references.
* Added `\value` and `\section{Side effects}` fields to docs for the various plot
functions. 
* Fixed bug in `mirror_plot` so legend can be fully hidden by setting `plot_legend`
to FALSE.
* Fixed bug in `scan_chrom` so additional arguments are passed to `plot_spectrum`.
* Added `color` argument to customize color of fitted peaks in `plot.peak_list`.
* Fixed plot functions and examples so they don't change par settings.
* Other small updates to documents (mostly formatting or small clarifications).
* Fixed `plot.peak_table` so it can return spectra if `export_spectrum` is TRUE.
* Added error for `box_plot` option in `plot.peak_table` if metadata is not attached.
* Added error for `box_plot` option in `plot.peak_table` if peak is not provided to `loc`.
* Added error in `plot_spectrum` function for user-supplied retention times beyond
the edges of the chromatogram.
* Added error in `plot_spectrum` function for unspecified `lambda` (if `what=="click`).


# chromatographR 0.4.0

* Added support for variable penalty dynamic time warping (VPdtw) through
`correct_rt` function.
* Fixed bug in get_peaks function.
* Allow preprocessing without interpolation.
* Fixed bug so preprocess can work on Windows (without parallel processing).
* Allow use of raw data for peak integration in `get_peaks`.
* Added `verbose` option to `correct_rt` to print reference chromatogram.

# chromatographR 0.3

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
